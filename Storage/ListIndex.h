 * Index based on list of sub-archives.
 * <p>
 * Ideally, an index configuration conforming to indexfile.dtd
 * is used to create a master index via the ArchiveIndexTool.
 * Alternatively, that list of sub-archives can be used with
 * a ListIndex, which then acts like a master index by simply
 * querying the sub-archives one by one:
 * - Less efficient for retrieval
 * - Easier to set up and maintain, because
 *   you only create the config file without need
 *   to run the ArchiveIndexTool whenever any of
 *   the sub-archives change.
 * <p>
 * It is important to remember that the samples are not "merged"
 * in any way. When data for a channel is requested, the very
 * first sub-archive which includes that channel is used.
 * Assume the following sub-archive:
 * 1) Channels A, B, X
 * 2) Channels C, D, X (but different time range for X)
 * <p>
 * We can now request data for channels A, B, C and D as if
 * they were all in one combined archive.
 * For channel X, however, will will mostly get data from
 * sub-archive 1, EXCEPT(!!) when we were just looking at channels
 * C or D from archive 2, because for efficiency reasons,
 * any channel lookup will first try the currently open
 * sub-archive.
 * <p>
 * Conclusion: You will often not able to predict what
 * sub-archive you are using when channels are in more than
 * one sub-archive.
 * You should only use the ListIndex for non-overlapping
 * sub-archives. This makes some sense, because why would
 * you want to archive channels in more than one sub-archive
 * in the first place?
